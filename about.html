    <h2>Details About Video Editing</h2>
    <p><b>

        Video Editors are generally responsible for editing and assembling recorded raw material into a suitable,
        finished product ready for broadcasting. The material may include camera footage, dialogue, sound effects,
        graphics and special effects.
      </b></p>

    <p><b>

        Video editing is the manipulation and arrangement of video shots. Video editing is used to structure and present
        all video information, including films and television shows, video advertisements and video essays. Video
        editing has been dramatically democratized in recent years by editing software available for personal computers.
        Editing video can be difficult and tedious, so several technologies have been produced to aid people in this
        task. Pen based video editing software was developed in order to give people a more intuitive and fast way to
        edit video.[1]
      </b></p>



    <p><b>

        Types of editing
        Though once the province of expensive machines called video editors, video editing software is now available for
        personal computers and workstations. Video editing includes cutting segments (trimming), re-sequencing clips,
        and adding transitions and other special effects.[2]

        Linear video editing uses video tape and is edited in a very linear way. Several video clips from different
        tapes are recorded to one single tape in the order that they will appear.
        Non-linear editing systems (NLE) allow video to be edited on computers with specialized software. This process
        is not destructive to the raw video footage and is done by using programs such as DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media
        Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.
        Offline editing is the process by which raw footage is copied from an original source, without affecting the
        original film stock or video tape. Once the editing is complete, the original media is then re-assembled in the
        online editing stage.
        Online editing is the process of reassembling the edit to full resolution video after an offline edit has been
        performed. It is done in the final stage of a video production.
        Cloud-based editing is the process of utilising the internet to work with content remotely, collaboratively or
        of a time-critical nature such as editing of live sports events in real-time using video proxies (lower
        resolution copies) of original material.
        Vision mixing is used when working within live television and video production environments. A vision mixer is
        used to cut live feed coming from several cameras in real time.

    <p><b>

        Like some other technologies, the cost of video editing has declined over time. The original 2" Quadruplex
        system cost so much that many television production facilities could only afford a single unit, and editing was
        a highly involved process that required special training. In contrast to this, nearly any home computer sold
        since the year 2000 has the speed and storage capacity to digitize and edit standard-definition television
        (SDTV). The two major retail operating systems include basic video editing software â€“ Apple's iMovie and
        Microsoft's Windows Movie Maker. Additional options exist, usually as more advanced commercial products. As well
        as these commercial products, there are open-source[6] video-editing programs. Automatic video editing products
        have also emerged, opening up video editing to a broader audience of amateurs and reducing the time it takes to
        edit videos. These exist usually as media storage services, such as Google with its Google Photos[7] or smaller
        companies like Vidify.
